# scrape_mars.py

# Create a function called scrape that will execute all of your scraping 
# code from above and return one Python dictionary containing all of the
# scraped data.

# Create a route called /scrape that will import your scrape_mars.py script
# and call your scrape function.

# Store the return value in Mongo as a Python dictionary.

# Create a root route / that will query your Mongo database and
# pass the Mars data into an HTML template to display the data.

# Create a template HTML file called index.html that will take the Mars 
# data dictionary and display all of the data in the appropriate HTML elements.
